# wikipedia-viewer
As part of freeCodeCamp's intermediate front end development projects (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer)

To view the rendered Wikipedia Viewer, visit https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/chanclarence/wikipedia-viewer/blob/master/index.html. Snippets of JavaScript code were coded with help from Dylan Israel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Wi_NYysX-LfcqT3Hq9Faw. Please pardon the multiple commits, as I am still learning and getting used to using GitHub.
